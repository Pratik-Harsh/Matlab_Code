This is the Matlab code for the two-stage reconfiguration method proposed in the letter entitled "A simple and fast heuristic approach for the reconfiguration of radial distribution networks" submitted to "IEEE Power Engineering Letters" for publication. The letter is available on https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3256136

The main code is 'main_program.m'. The input data for five test systems (33-bus, 69-bus, 84-bus, 136-bus, and 417-bus) are provided in the code. The user needs to uncomment the test systems for which reconfiguration needs to be performed.
